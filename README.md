 ## Fitness Tracker API – Endterm Project

## Project Overview

This project is developed as an Endterm assignment for the course.
It is a Spring Boot RESTful API that demonstrates:

* CRUD operations
* Layered architecture
* SOLID principles
* Design patterns
* Global exception handling
* One-to-Many database relationships

The application manages **Users** and their **Workouts** in a fitness tracking system.



## Technologies Used

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* H2 In-Memory Database
* Maven
* Lombok
* Postman



## Project Structure

The project follows a clean layered architecture:

```
src/main/java
 ├── controller
 ├── service
 ├── repository
 ├── model
 ├── exception
 ├── patterns
 ├── utils
 └── FitnessTrackerApplication.java

src/main/resources
 └── application.properties

## Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture**:

* **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses
* **Service Layer** – Contains business logic
* **Repository Layer** – Communicates with database
* **Model Layer** – Entity classes
* **Exception Layer** – Custom exceptions and global error handling



## Database

* H2 In-Memory database is used
* Schema is auto-generated by Hibernate
* Relationship:

```
User 1  ----  * Workout
```

Each user can have multiple workouts.

# Design Patterns Used

### Builder Pattern

Used for flexible and readable object creation.

### Repository Pattern

Used for database abstraction via Spring Data JPA.

### Service Layer Pattern

Separates business logic from controller logic.



# Exception Handling

The project includes:

* Custom `ResourceNotFoundException`
* Global exception handler
* Proper HTTP status codes:

  * 400 – Bad Request
  * 404 – Not Found
  * 500 – Internal Server Error



# SOLID Principles Applied

* **S** – Single Responsibility (each layer has one responsibility)
* **O** – Open/Closed (extensible without modifying core logic)
* **L** – Liskov Substitution
* **I** – Interface Segregation
* **D** – Dependency Inversion (constructor injection with Lombok)



# API Testing

All endpoints were tested using **Postman**.
Screenshots are stored in:

```
docs/screenshots
```



# H2 Console Access (Optional)

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```

JDBC URL:

```
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
```

Username:

```
sa
```

Password:

```
(empty)
```



# How to Run the Application

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
Load Maven dependencies
Run `FitnessTrackerApplication`
Open Postman or browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
